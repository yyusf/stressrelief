          Common sources of work stress
          <p>
            Certain factors tend to go hand-in-hand with work-related stress.
            Some common workplace stressors are:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Low salaries</li>
            <li>Excessive workloads</li>
            <li>few opportunities for growth or advancement</li>
            <li>work that isn't engaging or challenging</li>
            <li>lack of social support</li>
            <li>not having enough control over job related decisions</li>
            <li>conflicting demands or unclear performance expectations</li>
          </ul>

        <h1>Taking steps to manage stress</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading">Track your stressors</h2>
        <p>
          Keep a journal for a week or two to identify which situations create
          the most stress and how you respond to them. Record your thoughts,
          feelings, and information about the environment, including the people
          and circumstances involved, the physical setting, and how you reacted.
          Did you raise your voice? Get a snack from the vending machine? Go for
          a walk? Taking notes can help you find patterns among your stressors
          and your reactions to them.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Develop healthy responses</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of attempting to fight stress with fast food or alcohol, do
          your best to make healthy choices when you feel the tension rise.
          Exercise is a great stress-buster. Yoga can be an excellent choice,
          but any form of physical activity is beneficial. Also make time for
          hobbies and favorite activities. Whether it’s reading a novel, going
          to concerts, or playing games with your family, make sure to set aside
          time for the things that bring you pleasure. Getting enough
          good-quality sleep is also important for effective stress management.
          Build healthy sleep habits by limiting your caffeine intake late in
          the day and minimizing stimulating activities, such as computer and
          television use, at night.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Establish boundaries</h2>
        <p>
          In today’s digital world, it’s easy to feel pressure to be available
          24 hours a day. Establish some work-life boundaries for yourself. That
          might mean making a rule not to check email from home in the evening,
          or not answering the phone during dinner. Although people have
          different preferences when it comes to how much they blend their work
          and home life, creating some clear boundaries between these realms can
          reduce the potential for work-life conflict and the stress that goes
          with it.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Take time to recharge</h2>
        <p>
          To avoid the negative effects of chronic stress and burnout, we need
          time to replenish and return to our pre-stress level of functioning.
          This recovery process requires “switching off” from work by having
          periods of time when you are neither engaging in work-related
          activities, nor thinking about work. That’s why it’s critical that you
          disconnect from time to time, in a way that fits your needs and
          preferences. Don’t let your vacation days go to waste. When possible,
          take time off to relax and unwind, so you come back to work feeling
          reinvigorated and ready to perform at your best. When you’re not able
          to take time off, get a quick boost by turning off your smartphone and
          focusing your attention on nonwork activities for a while.
        </p>

        <h2>Learn how to relax</h2>
        <p>
          Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and
          mindfulness (a state in which you actively observe present experiences
          and thoughts without judging them) can help melt away stress. Start by
          taking a few minutes each day to focus on a simple activity like
          breathing, walking, or enjoying a meal. The skill of being able to
          focus purposefully on a single activity without distraction will get
          stronger with practice and you’ll find that you can apply it to many
          different aspects of your life.
        </p>

        <h2>Talk to your supervisor</h2>
        <p>

          mindfulness (a state in which you actively observe present experiences
          and thoughts without judging them) can help melt away stress. Start by
          taking a few minutes each day to focus on a simple activity like

        <h2>Get some support</h2>
        <p>
          Accepting help from trusted friends and family members can improve
          your ability to manage stress. Your employer may also have stress
          management resources available through an employee assistance program,
          including online information, available counseling, and referral to
          mental health professionals, if needed. If you continue to feel
          overwhelmed by work stress, you may want to talk to a psychologist,
          who can help you better manage stress and change unhealthy behavior.
